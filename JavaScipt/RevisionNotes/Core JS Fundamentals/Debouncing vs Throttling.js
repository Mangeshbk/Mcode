// Debouncing vs Throttling;

/*
ex1: 
{11 key stroke event}
SearchBar ==> if we are searching anything, on each and every keyPress event(it has 11 stroke event), by using deboucing and thottling we can manage this.

debouncing: make api call if diff b/w two key stroke event {ex 300ms} than only api call makes.
Throtlling: only make the API call after surten time.

ex2:
track the user when the user is resizing the browser;

ex3: 
on button click
