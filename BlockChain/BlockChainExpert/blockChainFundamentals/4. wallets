remeber these terms private key, public key and address

Private Key:  of an account acts as the password for that
    account. Any person with access to the private key can send/sign
    transactions and access the funds associated with that private keys account.
    Private keys should be stored in a secure location (ideally multiple secure
    locations) and should never be shared online or with other people.

Public key : A blockchain accounts public key is derived from a private key and acts as the identifier for an account. Nodes on
    a network can validate transactions that were signed properly using an
    account's public key. It is safe to share your public key.
  
  Note: a public key is a longer and less convenient form of an address.

Hash Function :  are known as "one-way" functions that have
    no known inverse. They are the foundation of modern internet security and
    cryptography. Hash functions have the following properties.
  
  -Fast to compute.
  -Generate a uniform output (a.k.a digest).
  -No known inverse.
  -Deterministic.
  -Very rare hash collisions.
