WEB 1.0 : refers to the first stage of the internet, also
know as the "read-only internet". Web 1.0 focused heavily on providing
information with limited focus on user experience, user generated context
and web design.

- The era of Web 1.0 was from roughly 1991 to 2004
- Mostly static Pages
- Referref to as the read only web
- Running advertisement was banned
- Mostly used for information and research
- Frames and tables were used to position and align elements

WEB 2.0 : is the era of the internet most people are very
familiar with. It has a large focus on community, social media, user
experience and how users interact with web pages. Web 2.0 brought the
popularity of AJAX and JavaScript for designing dynamic websites. During Web
2.0 there was a large focus on front-end user interfaces and design. One of
the major downsides of Web 2.0 is that data is controlled by intermediaries
(e.g. Facebook, Google, Amazon etc.) and privacy is limited.

- highlights user-generated content
- Interactions, social media, communities, GUI's(Graphical user Interfaces)
- Large focus on UI/UX design
- Brought the popularity of AJAX and JavaScript for dynamic websites
- Community focused
- user data owned and controlled by intermediaries(Google, FB, Amazon etc.)

WEB 3.0 : is an idea for a new iteration of the world-wide
web which is focused heavily on backend systems, ledgers, and
decentralization. Blockchains, artificial intelligence and token-based
economics are prevalent in Web 3.0. Web 3.0 is focused on user immersion
rather than interaction and aims to share data rather than have it be
controlled by intermediaries. In Web 3.0 no one person or entity controls
the internet or services provided on it, rather it is distributed and
decentralized.

- Large focus on backend systems, databases and ledgers
- Data isn't owned by a single party, it is shared
- Portable and personal
- Immersion over interaction
- Blockchain and decentralization
- Artificial Intelligence
