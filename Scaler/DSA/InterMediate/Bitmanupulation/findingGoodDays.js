Problem Description
Alex has a cat named Boomer. He decides to put his cat to the test for eternity.
He starts on day 1 with one stash of food unit, every next day, the stash doubles.
If Boomer is well behaved during a particular day, only then she receives food worth equal to the stash produced on that day.
Boomer receives a net worth of A units of food. What is the number of days she received the stash?

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 5
Input 2:
A = 8

Example Output
Output 1:
 2
Output 2:
 1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
To eat a total of 5 units of food, Boomer behaved normally on Day 1 and on the Day 3.

Explanation 2:
To eat a total of 8 units of food, Boomer behaved normally only on day 4.

Approach
Since for each day, the food doubles up as the previous day with 1 unit on the first day, starting from i = 0,
the number of food units Boomer was supposed to get on ith day is 2i.
Only on the days he was well behaved did he get food. So adding the power of 2 on each day, he was well behaved,
gives the total number of food units, i.e., A.
Hence, the number of 1â€™s in the binary representation of A is the number of days he was well behaved.

  while (A > 0) {
    if ((A & 1) == 1) {
      dayCount++;
    }
    A = A >> 1; // right shifting makes number half most of the cases
  }
