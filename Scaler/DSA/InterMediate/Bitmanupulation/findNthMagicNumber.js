Problem Description
Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.
A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.
First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

Example Input
Example Input 1:
 A = 3
Example Input 2:
 A = 10

Example Output
Example Output 1:
 30
Example Output 2:
 650

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Magic Numbers in increasing order are [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
 3rd element in this is 30
Explanation 2:
 In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.

Approach
As we know **5n > 51 + 52 + ... + 5n-1**
So, we can find the sum of all subsets of the first 13 power of 5.
since no element will overlap, we will have 2^13 - 1 elements or 8000 elements.
Simply sort them and answer the query in O(1).
Time Complexity: O(A*logA).

Else we can use a much faster approach.
We can represent A in its binary representation.
If the ith bit(1 based indexing) is set we will add 5i to our answer.
Time Complexity:- O(log(A))

function findNthMagicNumber(A) {
  /*
  let ans = 0,
    x = 1;
  // converting to binary representation
  while (A > 0) {
    x *= 5;
    if (A % 2 == 1) ans += x;
    A = Math.floor(A / 2);
  }
  return ans;
  */
  let ans = 0;
  let i = 1;

  while (A > 0) {
    if ((A & 1) == 1) {
      //checking the last bit if its 1 or not
      ans = ans + Math.pow(5, i);
    }
    i++;
    A = A >> 1; // right shift
  }
  return ans;
}
console.log(findNthMagicNumber(10)); // 650
console.log(findNthMagicNumber(11)); // 655
console.log(findNthMagicNumber(12)); // 750
