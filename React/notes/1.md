# React.js Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. What is React?

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components in response to data changes.

---

## 2. Explain the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?

- **Real DOM:** Directly manipulates the DOM structure and updates slower compared to Virtual DOM.
- **Virtual DOM:** A lightweight representation of the Real DOM that allows efficient updates by computing differences (diffing) and applying minimal updates to the Real DOM.

| Feature            | Real DOM                         | Virtual DOM                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Updates**        | Updates are slow.                | Updates are fast.                   |
| **Representation** | Direct representation of the UI. | In-memory representation of the UI. |
| **Efficiency**     | Inefficient DOM manipulation.    | Efficient diffing algorithm.        |
| **Re-rendering**   | Re-renders the entire UI.        | Re-renders only changed components. |

---

## 3. What are the key features of React?

1. **Virtual DOM** for efficient rendering.
2. **Component-based Architecture**.
3. **Declarative UI**.
4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**.
5. **JSX Syntax**.
6. **React Hooks** for functional components.
7. **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**.
8. **React Developer Tools**.

---

## 4. What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML and is used to describe the UI structure in React.

**Example:**

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

---

## 5. Why can't browsers read JSX?

Browsers can’t interpret JSX directly because it isn’t valid JavaScript. JSX needs to be transpiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel.

---

## 6. What are React components?

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI.

---

## 7. Differentiate between a Class component and a Functional component.

- **Class Component:** ES6 classes with lifecycle methods and `this` keyword.
- **Functional Component:** Simpler syntax and can use hooks for state and side effects.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Class Component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

// Functional Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

---

## 8. What is the difference between state and props in React?

- **State:** Managed internally by the component.
- **Props:** Passed from parent to child components and are read-only.

---

## 9. What are React hooks? Name some common hooks.

Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and other React features.

**Common hooks:**

### 1. `useState`

Allows functional components to have local state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times</button>
  );
}
```

### 2. `useEffect`

Used for side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs only once.

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</div>;
}
```

### 3. `useContext`

Access context values without wrapping components in a Consumer.

```jsx
import React, { useContext, createContext } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext("light");

function ThemeButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button>{theme} Theme</button>;
}
```

### 4. `useReducer`

Manages complex state logic.

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      <span>{state.count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. `useRef`

Access DOM elements or persist values without causing re-renders.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function InputFocus() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.focus()}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. `useMemo`

Memoize expensive calculations.

```jsx
import React, { useMemo, useState } from "react";

function ExpensiveComponent({ num }) {
  const compute = (num) => {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) result += num;
    return result;
  };

  const result = useMemo(() => compute(num), [num]);

  return <div>Result: {result}</div>;
}
```

---

## 10. How do `useState` and `useEffect` work in React?

- **`useState`**: Manages state in a functional component.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- **`useEffect`**: Handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");
}, []); // Dependency array
```

---

## 11. What is the importance of key in React?

`key` helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed, optimizing the rendering process in lists.

---

## 12. Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.

When two or more components need to share the same state, the state is moved to their closest common ancestor.

---

## 13. How does one pass data between components in React?

Data can be passed using **props** from parent to child components or using context or a state management library.

---

## 14. What are the new features introduced in React 18?

- Concurrent rendering.
- Automatic batching.
- `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` hooks.
- Improved Suspense.

---

## 15. What is concurrent rendering in React 18?

Concurrent rendering allows React to interrupt rendering work and focus on urgent updates, improving responsiveness.

---

## 16. How does automatic batching work in React 18?

React groups multiple state updates into a single render to reduce re-renders and improve performance.

---

## 17. What is `useTransition` hook, and how does it work?

`useTransition` prioritizes updates by marking non-urgent updates as low-priority.

**Example:**

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(() => setState(newValue));
```

---

## 18. Explain the working of `useDeferredValue` in React 18.

`useDeferredValue` defers the re-render of non-urgent updates.

**Example:**

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

---

## 19. What is Suspense in React, and how does it work?

Suspense enables waiting for some code to load or data to fetch before rendering a component.

---

## 20. How has React 18 improved Suspense?

Suspense now works with server-side rendering and data fetching.

---

## 21. What is the new `startTransition` function in React 18?

`startTransition` schedules updates as non-urgent, improving UI responsiveness.

---

## 22. What is the difference between `useTransition` and `startTransition`?

- **`useTransition`**: Hook for component-level transitions.
- **`startTransition`**: Function for scheduling transitions globally.

---

## 23. How do you use the Concurrent Features introduced in React 18?

Concurrent features are enabled automatically in React 18 and can be used with `useTransition`, `startTransition`, and Suspense.

---

## 24. How does React 18 enhance server-side rendering (SSR)?

React 18 introduces streaming SSR with Suspense for partial hydration.

---

## 25. What is React Server Components, and how does it work with React 18?

Server components enable rendering components on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript.

---

## 26. What role does the `concurrentMode` flag play in React 18?

`concurrentMode` is now replaced with concurrent rendering by default in React 18.

---

## 27. Explain the React lifecycle methods in detail.

React lifecycle methods include mounting (`componentDidMount`), updating (`componentDidUpdate`), and unmounting (`componentWillUnmount`).

---

## 28. What is React Context API, and when would you use it?

Context API allows sharing data across components without prop drilling.

**Example:**

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
```

---

## 29. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?

HOCs are functions that take a component and return an enhanced version of it.

**Example:**

```jsx
const withEnhancement = (Component) => (props) => {
  return <Component {...props} />;
};
```

---

## 30. How does React handle forms and controlled components?

Controlled components have their value controlled by state.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

---

## 31. What are uncontrolled components in React?

Uncontrolled components rely on refs instead of state to manage their value.

---

## 32. What is Prop Drilling, and how can it be avoided?

Prop drilling occurs when data is passed through multiple layers of components. It can be avoided using Context API or state management libraries.

---

## 33. What are React Portals, and when should you use them?

Portals render children into a DOM node outside the parent component.

**Example:**

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

---

## 34. What is the significance of React’s `shouldComponentUpdate` method?

`shouldComponentUpdate` improves performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 35. What are Fragments in React?

Fragments allow grouping of elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**Example:**

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</>
```

---

## 36. Explain the concept of memoization in React using `React.memo` and `useMemo`.

- `React.memo`: Prevents re-rendering of functional components unless props change.
- `useMemo`: Memoizes the result of a computation.

---

## 37. How Do You Optimize Performance in a React Application?

1. Use `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
2. Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive computations and function references.
3. Avoid inline functions in props.
4. Split code using lazy loading and `React.Suspense`.
5. Enable production build for performance optimizations.
6. Use tools like React Developer Tools Profiler.

---

## 38. Rules for Using React Hooks

1. **Call Hooks at the Top Level**: Don’t use hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. **Only Call Hooks from React Functions**: They can only be used in functional components or custom hooks.
3. **Follow Naming Convention**: Always start custom hooks with `use`.

---

## 39. Handling Errors in React Using Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child components and render a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error("Error:", error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

---

## 40. `componentDidCatch` Method

Used in class components to handle errors in child components and log them.

```jsx
componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
  console.error("Logged Error:", error, errorInfo);
}
```

---

## 41. Synthetic Events in React

Synthetic events are a cross-browser wrapper around native events in React.

```jsx
function handleClick(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log("Button clicked!");
}
```

---

## 42. Testing React Components

Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

```jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

test("renders learn react link", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## 43. Role of Jest in React Testing

Jest is a testing framework used for unit and integration testing in React.

---

## 44. Shallow Rendering vs. Full Rendering

- **Shallow Rendering**: Tests components in isolation without rendering children.
- **Full Rendering**: Renders children components for integration tests.

---

## 45. Implementing Lazy Loading in React

Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

## React Working Mechanism

React uses a Virtual DOM to track changes and efficiently update the Real DOM by comparing diffs (reconciliation).

---

## Higher Order Component (HOC) Example

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new one.

```jsx
function withLogger(Component) {
  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
    console.log("Rendering", Component.name);
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
}
```

---

## Pure Component Example

Pure components only re-render when their props or state change.

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from "react";

class MyComponent extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.text}</div>;
  }
}
```

---

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

- **Controlled**: State is managed by React.
- **Uncontrolled**: State is managed by the DOM.

**Controlled Example**:

```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

**Uncontrolled Example**:

```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 46. What are PropTypes in React?

PropTypes is a type-checking feature in React that ensures components receive props of the correct data type. It helps identify bugs by validating the types of props passed to components.

```jsx
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const Greeting = ({ name, age }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    <p>Age: {age}</p>
  </div>
);

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number,
};
```

### 47. What is Redux, and how is it used in React?

Redux is a state management library that provides a centralized store for managing application state. It works well with React by using the `react-redux` library to connect the Redux store to React components.

#### Key Concepts of Redux:

- **Store**: Holds the entire state of the application.
- **Actions**: Describes the changes you want to make to the state.
- **Reducers**: Specifies how the state changes in response to actions.

Example:

```jsx
// actions.js
export const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });

// reducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };
export const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// App.js
import { createStore } from "redux";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { counterReducer } from "./reducer";

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>
);
```

### 48. What is the difference between Context API and Redux?

| Feature          | Context API              | Redux                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Simplifies state sharing | Centralized state management |
| Use Case         | Localized state sharing  | Complex state management     |
| Boilerplate Code | Minimal                  | Requires setup               |
| Middleware       | Not supported            | Supported                    |

### 49. How do you handle side effects in Redux?

Side effects in Redux, such as API calls, can be handled using middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`.

#### Example with redux-thunk:

```jsx
// actions.js
export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/data");
  const data = await response.json();
  dispatch({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data });
};
```

### 50. What is the difference between React.memo and useMemo?

| Feature | React.memo                                | useMemo                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Memoizes a component to avoid re-renders  | Memoizes a value or computation                           |
| Usage   | Wrapping components                       | Inside functional components                              |
| Example | `export default React.memo(MyComponent);` | `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => compute(), [deps]);` |

### 51. What is the difference between useCallback and useMemo?

| Feature      | useCallback               | useMemo                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Memoizes functions        | Memoizes values or computations |
| Return Value | Returns memoized function | Returns memoized value          |

### 52. What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is the underlying algorithm in React that allows incremental rendering. It improves rendering performance and enables features like Suspense and Concurrent Mode.

### 53. How does hydration work in React?

Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners to the DOM elements rendered by React on the server. It is used in server-side rendering (SSR) to make the app interactive.

### 54. What are static methods in React components?

Static methods are methods declared with the `static` keyword that belong to the class, not its instances. These are often used for defining helper functions.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static displayName = "MyComponent";

  static greet() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
}

console.log(MyComponent.greet()); // Hello!
```

### 55. What are the best practices for structuring a React application?

- Use **functional components** over class components.
- Maintain a **clear folder structure**.
- Use **PropTypes** or TypeScript for type checking.
- Optimize performance with **React.memo** and **lazy loading**.
- Centralize state management with **Context API** or **Redux**.
- Keep components **small and reusable**.

### 56. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

| Feature        | useEffect                 | useLayoutEffect               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Execution Time | After rendering           | Before painting to the screen |
| Use Case       | Non-blocking side effects | Blocking updates to the DOM   |

### 57. How does React handle updates to child components?

React updates child components when:

- Their **props** change.
- Their **state** changes.
- A **parent re-renders** unless optimized with `React.memo` or `shouldComponentUpdate`.

### 58. What is StrictMode in React?

StrictMode is a development-only feature that highlights potential problems in an application.

Example:

```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

### 59. How do you create a reusable modal in React?

```jsx
const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className='modal-backdrop'>
      <div className='modal-content'>
        {children}
        <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 60. How does React handle accessibility?

React supports accessibility standards by using:

- Semantic HTML.
- ARIA attributes like `role`, `aria-label`.
- Tools like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`.

## Advanced Topics

### 61. What is a render prop in React?

A render prop is a technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

```jsx
const MouseTracker = ({ render }) => {
  const [position, setPosition] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  };

  return <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>{render(position)}</div>;
};
```

### 62. How does React handle animations?

React handles animations using libraries like:

- **CSS Transitions**: Use `className` changes.
- **React Transition Group**: For managing animations on component mount/unmount.
- **Framer Motion**: For advanced animations.

### 63. What is the useImperativeHandle hook?

`useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value exposed when using `React.forwardRef`.

Example:

```jsx
const CustomInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => inputRef.current.focus(),
  }));

  return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />;
});
```

---

### 1. **What is the difference between `React.createElement` and JSX?**

`React.createElement` is a method used to create and return a React element. JSX is a syntactic sugar for `React.createElement` and makes the code more readable and expressive.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Using React.createElement
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "title" },
  "Hello, React!"
);

// Using JSX
const element = <h1 className='title'>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

### 2. **What is reconciliation in React?**

Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM efficiently. It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

### 3. **What is the difference between `useRef` and `createRef`?**

- `createRef` is used in class components to create a reference to an element.
- `useRef` is used in functional components to persist a mutable reference across renders without causing re-renders.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Using useRef in a functional component
function App() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Using createRef in a class component
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }

  focusInput = () => {
    this.inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <input ref={this.inputRef} />
        <button onClick={this.focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. **What are default props in React?**

Default props are used to define default values for props when they are not provided by the parent component.

#### Example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest",
};

<Greeting />; // Outputs: Hello, Guest!
```

### 5. **What are controlled and uncontrolled inputs in forms?**

- **Controlled Inputs:** React state controls the input value. The value of the input element is determined by the state.
- **Uncontrolled Inputs:** The input element manages its own state internally without React state.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Controlled Input
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}

// Uncontrolled Input
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 6. **What is the `key` prop in React, and why is it important?**

The `key` prop is a unique identifier used by React to track and identify components during reconciliation. It helps optimize rendering by updating only the necessary components.

#### Example:

```jsx
const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

const list = items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
```

### 7. **What is the difference between `React.Fragment` and `<></>`?**

Both are used to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. The shorthand syntax (`<>...</>`) is more concise but does not support key attributes.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Using React.Fragment
<React.Fragment>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Subtitle</p>
</React.Fragment>

// Using shorthand
<>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Subtitle</p>
</>
```

### 8. **What are React's new features in React 19?**

React 19 introduces several improvements (hypothetical future features):

- Enhanced Concurrent Rendering
- Native Suspense with improved data fetching
- Native TypeScript support

### 9. **What is the difference between `useMemo` and `React.memo`?**

- `useMemo`: Optimizes performance by memoizing values in functional components.
- `React.memo`: Prevents re-renders of a component if its props have not changed.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Using useMemo
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

// Using React.memo
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

### 10. **How does the React working mechanism function?**

React follows a declarative model and uses the Virtual DOM for efficient rendering. When a state or prop changes:

1. React creates a new Virtual DOM.
2. It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing).
3. React calculates the minimal updates and applies them to the actual DOM (reconciliation).
